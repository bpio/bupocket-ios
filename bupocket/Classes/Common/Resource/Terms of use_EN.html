        <p><b>4. Risk Warnings</b></p>

        <p>You are aware that digital tokens may pose major risks, such as irredeemability and technical instability, because laws, regulations and policies in the field of digital tokens are not yet sound. You also know that the price fluctuation of digital tokens is much higher than that of other financial assets. We cautiously remind you that you should choose to hold or dispose of any digital token in a reasonable way based on your financial situation and risk preferences. You also know that the Quote View feature provided by BU Pocket App is only a search result that captures digital token exchange rate information from some exchanges and is not meant to be the latest or best offer.</p>

        <p>If you or your counterpart fails to comply with this agreement or the instructions and rules of the relevant website, transaction and payment pages, we do not guarantee the smooth completion of the fair, and we are not liable for damages. In the event that the money has been entered into your or your dealer&#39;s BU Pocket App wallet or a third-party wallet, you understand the &quot;irreversible&quot; nature of block chain operations and the &quot;irrevocable&quot; nature of related transactions, with you and your counterpart assuming the corresponding risk and consequences.</p>

        <p>When you use third-party DApp, third-party smart contract services integrated with BU Pocket App, we strongly recommend that you read the user agreement and other relevant documents and information of the third-party DApp and the third-party smart contract carefully, understand the transaction object and product information, carefully assess the risk. Transactions are carried out on third party intelligent contracts. You understand that this transaction and binding contractual relationship are established between you and your counterpart and have nothing to do with us. We are not liable for all risks, liabilities, losses and expenses arising from your trading activities.</p>

        <p>When you transfer digital tokens to other wallet addresses, you should decide whether the other party is a person with full capacity for civil conduct and whether to conduct transactions with the other party or transfer money to the other party.</p>

        <p>In the course of transferring, if there is such abnormal information as &quot;transaction failure&quot;, &quot;packing timeout&quot; and so on, you should confirm it again through the official channel of the relevant block chain system or other block chain query tools to avoid duplicate transfers; otherwise, all losses and expenses arising therefrom should be on your own.</p>

        <p>You understand that when you create or import your wallet on the BU Pocket App, your wallet password, mnemonics, and other information is stored only on the current mobile device, not on the BU Pocket App or our server. You can change the mobile device by synchronizing the wallet following the instructions provided by the BU Pocket App. But if you don&#39;t save or back up your wallet password, mnemonics and other information and if your mobile device is lost, your digital token will be lost, and we can&#39;t retrieve it for you. If your password is leaked when you export, save or back up your wallet password, mnemonics and other information, or when you save or back up the above information of the device or server, you are attacked or controlled by hackers, your digital token will be lost, we cannot retrieve it for you. Any and all losses arising from the foregoing circumstances shall be borne by you.</p>

        <p>We recommend that you make a secure backup of your wallet password, mnemonics, and other information when creating or importing your wallet. We call your attention, please do not use the following electronic backup methods: screenshots, e-mail, notebook applications in mobile phones, SMS, Wechat, QQ and other electronic backup methods. We recommend that you transcribe mnemonics in a paper notebook, and that you keep your electronic data in the password manager. </p>
